## Notes

* The application requires Python 3.
* On first run, the app may prompt to create a virtual environment and install dependencies.
* Linux installations require `pkexec` for elevated permissions to run properly.
* If you experience issues running the application, ensure all dependencies are installed and your environment variables (`DISPLAY`, `XAUTHORITY`) are correctly set.
* On Linux systems it always requires privileges to run the application. You can use the desktop shortcut to launch the app wit elevated permissions automatically, but you can also run `sudo autoclicker-launcher` to launch the app with elevated permissions from the terminal.
